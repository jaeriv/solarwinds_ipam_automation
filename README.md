SolarWinds IPAM automation examples using Python

A great starting point would be to download and use SWQL studio. Personally, this helped me understand the schema, discover useful verbs, and assisted in structuring queries. You can learn more about SWQL and the OrionSDK from the links at the end.

You can view the available verbs by using the query below:

SELECT Name, EntityName FROM Metadata.Verb
